A dashboard for the WHO Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports

To create a csv file from reports:
- Create a folder called "reports" and add Situation Reports (30+)
- Run the data_wrangler.py script.
- Reports earlier than the 19th February have a different format and i havent added handling for it.
- I do not extract data for China.
